## 14. Sprint Retrospective Meeting Minutes

**Path:** `.pdlc/sprints/sprint-N/meetings/sprint-retro.md`
**Created:** End of sprint (Friday), during REVIEW phase, after sprint review

```markdown
# Sprint N — Sprint Retrospective

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Facilitator:** scrum-master
**Participants:** ALL agents who participated in sprint N

## Opening
scrum-master: "Let's reflect on sprint N. What went well? What didn't? What should we change?"

## Agent Reflections

### react-specialist
**Went well:** "Stitch design-to-code pipeline saved significant time on S-N-01. The design specs from enhance-prompt were detailed enough to generate components with minimal tweaking."
**Didn't go well:** "S-N-03 took longer than estimated. The dashboard had complex state management I didn't anticipate in planning."
**Suggestion:** "For complex UI stories with lots of state, pair me with a state management specialist or add a spike first."

### backend-developer
**Went well:** "The API spec from api-designer was comprehensive. Made implementation straightforward."
**Didn't go well:** "Got blocked for half a day waiting on environment config. Lost momentum."
**Suggestion:** "All infrastructure/config stories should complete before feature stories start. Or at least the env setup story should be day 1 priority."

### security-auditor
**Went well:** "Caught the XSS vulnerability early in the testing phase."
**Didn't go well:** "The auth implementation didn't follow the security-design.md patterns. Had to flag as Critical critique."
**Suggestion:** "Development agents should be required to reference security-design.md during implementation, not just system-design.md."

### qa-expert
**Went well:** "Test coverage hit 78%, above our 70% target."
**Didn't go well:** "Integration tests took too long to write because there was no test data setup."
**Suggestion:** "Add a 'test infrastructure' story to sprint 1 that sets up fixtures and factories."

## scrum-master Synthesis

### What Went Well (team-wide)
- [Pattern across agents]
- [Pattern across agents]

### What Needs Improvement (team-wide)
- [Pattern across agents]
- [Pattern across agents]

### Committed Action Items for Sprint N+1
- [ ] [Specific, actionable change — e.g., "Sequence infra stories before feature stories"]
- [ ] [Specific change — e.g., "Add security-design.md to required reading for all dev agents"]
- [ ] [Specific change — e.g., "Add spike for any story estimated above 5 points"]

### Process Changes
- [Change to sprint structure, if any]
- [Change to agent assignments, if any]

## Confidence Trend
| Sprint | Confidence | Velocity | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Sprint 1 | XX/100 | X pts | [Brief note] |
| Sprint N | XX/100 | X pts | [Brief note] |

## 12. Decision Journal

**Path:** `.pdlc/architecture/decision-journal.md`
**Created:** During DESIGN phase, appended throughout project lifetime

Unlike ADRs (which capture formal architecture decisions), the decision journal captures the *reasoning process* — what alternatives were considered, what tradeoffs were debated, and why certain paths were rejected. This is what makes the system feel like a real engineering team thinking through problems.

## YYYY-MM-DD — [Decision Topic]

**Context:** [What problem or question came up]
**Decided by:** [agent-name]
**Phase:** [DESIGN / DEVELOPMENT / etc.]

### Options Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Effort |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| [Option A] | [Benefits] | [Drawbacks] | Low/Med/High |
| [Option B] | [Benefits] | [Drawbacks] | Low/Med/High |
| [Option C] | [Benefits] | [Drawbacks] | Low/Med/High |

### Chosen: [Option X]

**Reasoning:** [2-3 sentences explaining WHY this option won — not just what it is, but why it's the right call given the project's constraints, timeline, and goals]

**What would change this decision:** [Under what circumstances would we revisit this — e.g., "If we exceed 10k concurrent users, we'd need to move from SQLite to PostgreSQL"]

**Dissenting view:** [If another agent or review suggested a different approach, note it here — e.g., "architect-reviewer preferred Option B for long-term scalability, but we chose A for sprint 1 velocity"]

## 13. Design Critique Log

**Path:** `.pdlc/sprints/sprint-N/design-critiques.md`
**Created:** During TESTING/REVIEW phases when code-reviewer or architect-reviewer provides feedback

Real teams don't just pass artifacts forward — they push back. The design critique log captures the back-and-forth between agents: reviewer challenges, developer responses, and resolutions.

```markdown
# Sprint N Design Critiques

## Critique #1: [Topic]

**Raised by:** [code-reviewer / architect-reviewer / security-auditor]
**About:** [Story S-N-XX / component / architecture decision]
**Severity:** Critical / Major / Minor / Suggestion

**Issue:**
[What the reviewer flagged — e.g., "The auth middleware stores tokens in localStorage, which is vulnerable to XSS"]

**Original author's reasoning:**
[Why the developer agent made this choice — e.g., "Used localStorage for simplicity in sprint 1, planned to migrate to httpOnly cookies"]

**Resolution:**
[What was actually done — e.g., "Migrated to httpOnly cookies in this sprint. Added CSRF protection."]

**Status:** Resolved / Deferred to Sprint N+1 / Won't Fix (with justification)

```

## 14. Tech Debt Register

**Path:** `.pdlc/retrospective/tech-debt.md`
**Created:** After first sprint, maintained throughout project

Every shortcut, TODO, and "we'll fix this later" gets tracked here. The IMPROVE phase reviews this register and schedules paydown stories.

```markdown
# Tech Debt Register

## Active Debt

| ID | Description | Introduced | Sprint | Severity | Estimated Paydown | Owner |
|----|-------------|-----------|--------|----------|-------------------|-------|
| TD-001 | Hardcoded rate limits | Sprint 1 | S-1-03 | Medium | 2 points | backend-developer |
| TD-002 | No input validation on /api/upload | Sprint 1 | S-1-02 | High | 3 points | security-auditor |
| TD-003 | Duplicate CSS in auth and dashboard | Sprint 2 | S-2-01 | Low | 1 point | frontend-developer |

## Resolved Debt

| ID | Description | Introduced | Resolved | Resolution |
|----|-------------|-----------|----------|------------|
| TD-000 | Missing error boundaries | Sprint 1 | Sprint 2 | Added React ErrorBoundary wrapper |

## Debt Trend
- Sprint 1: +3 items introduced, 0 resolved (net: +3)
- Sprint 2: +2 items introduced, 1 resolved (net: +1, total: 4)

## Paydown Policy
- Each sprint reserves 20% of capacity for tech debt paydown
- High severity debt must be resolved within 2 sprints of introduction
- Critical severity debt blocks the current sprint until resolved
```

## 15. Sprint Confidence Score

**Path:** Included in `.pdlc/sprints/sprint-N/results.md` (added to Metrics section)
**Also aggregated in:** `.pdlc/dashboard.md`

A composite score (0-100) that reflects how "healthy" the sprint execution was. Low confidence = things went wrong, even if stories technically completed.

```markdown
## Sprint Confidence Score: XX/100

| Factor | Weight | Score | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| First-attempt success rate | 25% | XX/25 | [X of Y agents succeeded without retry] |
| Stories completed vs planned | 25% | XX/25 | [X of Y stories done] |
| Zero critical issues | 20% | XX/20 | [0 critical = full marks, else deduct] |
| No agent tier escalations | 15% | XX/15 | [Full marks if no sonnet→opus swaps needed] |
| Estimation accuracy | 15% | XX/15 | [Planned points vs actual within 20% = full] |

**Interpretation:**
- 90-100: Excellent — team is firing on all cylinders
- 70-89: Good — minor friction, trending well
- 50-69: Concerning — significant issues, review needed
- Below 50: Red flag — major process problems, consider re-planning
```

## 16. User Feedback Simulation

**Path:** `.pdlc/sprints/sprint-N/user-feedback.md`
**Created:** During REVIEW phase, after sprint demo

Real products get user testing. The orchestrator uses the user personas created in PLANNING to simulate how target users would react to the sprint deliverables. This feeds back into the next sprint's priorities.

```markdown
# Sprint N — Simulated User Feedback

**Based on personas from:** .pdlc/architecture/user-personas.md

## Persona: [Persona Name] — [Role/Description]

**Scenario tested:** [What user journey was simulated]

### Positive Reactions
- [What this persona would appreciate — e.g., "The onboarding flow is quick, only 2 steps"]

### Friction Points
- [What would frustrate them — e.g., "No way to skip the tutorial, feels forced"]
- [What's confusing — e.g., "The dashboard has too many metrics for a first-time user"]

### Feature Requests
- [What they'd ask for next — e.g., "I want to export my data as CSV"]

### Usability Score: X/10

---

## Persona: [Another Persona]
[Same structure]

---

## Aggregated Insights
- **Top friction point across personas:** [Most common issue]
- **Most requested feature:** [What to prioritize next]
- **Suggested sprint N+1 stories based on feedback:**
  - [ ] [Story idea from user feedback]
  - [ ] [Story idea from user feedback]
```

## 17. Spike / Prototype Notes

**Path:** `.pdlc/sprints/sprint-N/spikes.md`
**Created:** When a sprint includes exploratory/uncertain stories

Real teams don't jump into building risky features blind. Spikes are time-boxed investigations to reduce uncertainty before committing to full implementation.

```markdown
# Sprint N Spikes

## Spike: [Topic] — Time-boxed to [X hours/points]

**Question to answer:** [What are we trying to learn? — e.g., "Can we integrate Stripe Connect for marketplace payouts?"]

**Investigated by:** [agent-name]

### Findings
- [Finding 1: e.g., "Stripe Connect requires a Platform account, not a Standard one"]
- [Finding 2: e.g., "Express onboarding takes 5 min, Custom takes weeks"]
- [Finding 3: e.g., "Payout scheduling has a 2-day delay minimum"]

### Prototype Built
- [What was built — e.g., "Minimal Stripe Connect flow in /spikes/stripe-connect/"]
- [What it proved — e.g., "Express onboarding works, but needs webhook handling for account updates"]

### Recommendation
[Go / No-Go / Pivot — e.g., "GO with Express Connect. Add webhook handling story to Sprint N+1"]

### Risk Reduction
- **Before spike:** [High uncertainty — "we don't know if Stripe supports our use case"]
- **After spike:** [Low uncertainty — "confirmed feasible, clear implementation path"]
