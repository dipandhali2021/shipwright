# PDLC — Autonomous Product Development Life Cycle

This skill orchestrates the full product development life cycle using 100+ specialized agents. It researches trending projects, plans products, designs architecture, develops in sprints, tests, deploys, reviews, and self-improves — all autonomously.

## Role Hierarchy

The PDLC operates with a three-tier role structure:
- **Manager** (pdlc-orchestrator) -- oversees the full lifecycle, delegates to PMs and engineers, conducts coaching
- **Product Manager** (product-manager agent) -- owns the backlog, prioritizes features, evaluates deliverables
- **Software Engineers** (all development/testing/infra agents) -- execute assigned stories using specialized skills

The Manager never writes code. The PM never makes architecture decisions. Engineers never self-assign work.

## Sub-Commands

Parse the user's input to determine which command to execute:

| User Says | Command | Phases Executed |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| `/pdlc` (no args) | **resume** | Continue from current state |
| `/pdlc research` | **research** | RESEARCH only |
| `/pdlc plan` | **plan** | PLANNING + DESIGN |
| `/pdlc sprint` | **sprint** | DEVELOPMENT + TESTING |
| `/pdlc deploy` | **deploy** | DEPLOYMENT |
| `/pdlc review` | **review** | REVIEW + IMPROVE |
| `/pdlc full-cycle` | **full-cycle** | All 8 phases end-to-end |
| `/pdlc dashboard` | **dashboard** | Regenerate and display dashboard |
| `/pdlc roadmap` | **roadmap** | PLANNING (create) or REVIEW (update) |
| `/pdlc status` | **status** | Show current state |

Also match natural language:
- "what should I build" / "find trending projects" → **research**
- "start a new project" / "build something" → **full-cycle**
- "next sprint" / "continue building" → **sprint**
- "how's the project going" / "show progress" → **status**
- "sprint review" / "retrospective" → **review**
- "show roadmap" / "update roadmap" / "what's the plan" → **roadmap**

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Determine State

Check if `.pdlc/config.json` exists in the current working directory.

**If it exists:** Read it to determine `current_phase` and `current_sprint`. This is an existing PDLC project — resume from where it left off (unless a specific sub-command overrides).

**If it doesn't exist:** This is a new PDLC project. The orchestrator will initialize the `.pdlc/` directory structure. Default command is **full-cycle** starting from RESEARCH.

### Step 2: Route Command

Based on the parsed command:

#### `status`
1. Read `.pdlc/config.json`
2. Read `.pdlc/dashboard.md` if it exists
3. Display to user:
   - Project name and description
   - Current phase and sprint number
   - Key metrics (velocity, completion rate, test pass rate)
   - Recent activity
   - Next steps
4. Do NOT spawn any agents — this is a read-only operation.

#### `dashboard`
1. Read `.pdlc/config.json` and all sprint results
2. Spawn performance-monitor to collect latest metrics
3. Regenerate `.pdlc/dashboard.md` using the template from `references/templates.md`
4. Display the dashboard to the user

#### `roadmap`
1. If no roadmap exists (`.pdlc/architecture/roadmap.md` missing): verify PLANNING artifacts exist, then create the roadmap
2. If roadmap exists: update it with latest sprint data
3. Use the `roadmap-update` skill if installed; otherwise use product-manager + roadmap template
4. Display roadmap summary to the user

#### `research`
1. Initialize `.pdlc/` if needed, set `current_phase: "RESEARCH"`
2. Spawn the pdlc-orchestrator agent with directive: execute RESEARCH phase
3. The orchestrator handles all agent delegation per `references/agent-registry.md`
4. On completion: display the project selection results to the user

#### `plan`
1. Verify RESEARCH is complete (project-selection.md exists)
2. If not complete: run RESEARCH first, then continue to PLANNING
3. Spawn pdlc-orchestrator with directive: execute PLANNING + DESIGN phases
4. On completion: display the architecture summary and sprint plan to the user

#### `sprint`
1. Verify DESIGN is complete (tech-stack-decision.md exists)
2. If not complete: inform user and suggest running `/pdlc plan` first
3. Spawn pdlc-orchestrator with directive: execute one DEVELOPMENT + TESTING cycle
4. The orchestrator increments current_sprint and manages the full sprint lifecycle
5. On completion: display sprint results summary

#### `deploy`
1. Verify TESTING passed for the current sprint
2. Spawn pdlc-orchestrator with directive: execute DEPLOYMENT phase
3. On completion: display deployment status

#### `review`
1. Verify current sprint has been developed and tested
2. Spawn pdlc-orchestrator with directive: execute REVIEW + IMPROVE phases
3. On completion: display retrospective summary, improvement recommendations, and whether another sprint is needed

#### `full-cycle`
1. Initialize `.pdlc/` if needed
2. Spawn pdlc-orchestrator with directive: execute ALL phases end-to-end
3. The orchestrator runs RESEARCH → PLANNING → DESIGN → then loops (DEVELOPMENT → TESTING → DEPLOYMENT → REVIEW → IMPROVE) for each sprint until all planned sprints complete
4. On each phase completion: provide a brief status update to the user
5. On PDLC completion: display final project summary

#### `resume` (default, no args)
1. Read config.json to find current_phase
2. Resume execution from that phase:
   - INIT → start RESEARCH
   - RESEARCH → continue or complete RESEARCH
   - PLANNING → continue PLANNING
   - DESIGN → continue DESIGN
   - DEVELOPMENT → continue current sprint development
   - TESTING → continue testing
   - DEPLOYMENT → continue deployment
   - REVIEW → continue review
   - IMPROVE → continue improvement, then start next sprint
   - COMPLETE → inform user the project is done, offer to start a new one

### Step 3: Spawn Orchestrator

When spawning the pdlc-orchestrator, first read `agents/pdlc-orchestrator.md` for its full instructions. Then spawn a subagent using those instructions as its system prompt, along with this context:

```
Execute PDLC phase: [PHASE_NAME]

Project state:
- Project: [name from config.json or "new project"]
- Current phase: [phase]
- Current sprint: [N of M]
- Tech stack: [from config.json if set]

Reference files (read as needed):
- Agent registry: .claude/skills/pdlc/references/agent-registry.md
- Phase definitions: .claude/skills/pdlc/references/phase-definitions.md
- Templates: .claude/skills/pdlc/references/templates.md

Working directory: [current working directory]

Core agent instructions (read and provide to subagents as needed):
- Orchestrator: .claude/skills/pdlc/agents/pdlc-orchestrator.md
- Ceremony manager: .claude/skills/pdlc/agents/sprint-ceremony-manager.md
- GitHub ops: .claude/skills/pdlc/agents/github-ops-manager.md

[Any additional context from user input]
```

Available external skills (check before spawning):
- Sprint ceremony: sprint-planning, scrum-master, task-estimation, standup-meeting, sprint-retrospective
- Roadmap: roadmap-update
- GitHub: git-commit, github-issues, gh-cli, pr-create, prd, excalidraw-diagram-generator
- Video: remotion-best-practices
The orchestrator uses these skills to enhance ceremonies and GitHub workflows when available. If a skill is not installed, it falls back to built-in logic. GitHub skills are coordinated by the github-ops-manager (see `agents/github-ops-manager.md`); code-reviewer and architect-reviewer agents review sprint PRs before merge.

### Step 4: Report Results

After the orchestrator completes, read the produced artifacts and present a concise summary to the user:

- **After RESEARCH:** Show selected project name, score, and key differentiator
- **After PLANNING:** Show feature count, sprint count, and key milestones
- **After DESIGN:** Show tech stack decision and architecture summary
- **After DEVELOPMENT:** Show stories completed vs planned, any blockers
- **After TESTING:** Show test pass rate, issues found/resolved
- **After DEPLOYMENT:** Show deployment status
- **After REVIEW:** Show velocity trend, retrospective highlights
- **After IMPROVE:** Show top recommendations and adaptations made

## Error Handling

- If a phase fails after max retries: inform the user with a clear explanation of what went wrong and suggest next steps
- If config.json is missing but `.pdlc/` directory exists: attempt state recovery by reading artifacts
- If user runs a command out of order (e.g., `/pdlc deploy` before any code exists): explain the prerequisite and suggest the correct command

## Google Stitch MCP Integration

The PDLC system uses Google Stitch for AI-powered design-to-code workflows. Before executing DESIGN or DEVELOPMENT phases that involve UI/UX:

### Setup Check
Check if the `stitch` MCP server is available in the current session. If Stitch tools (`stitch-design`, `enhance-prompt`, `react-components`, etc.) are NOT available, inform the user:

```
Stitch MCP server is not configured. To enable AI-powered design-to-code:

claude mcp add stitch --transport http https://stitch.googleapis.com/mcp --header "X-Goog-Api-Key: YOUR_STITCH_API_KEY" -s user

Then restart Claude Code for the tools to become available.
```

### Stitch Tools Available
When Stitch is configured, these tools enhance the PDLC design workflow:

| Tool | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `enhance-prompt` | Refine vague UI ideas into detailed design specs |
| `stitch-design` | Generate high-fidelity screens and design systems |
| `design-md` | Create structured design documentation |
| `stitch-loop` | Generate complete multi-page site/app structure |
| `react-components` | Convert designs to validated React components |
| `shadcn-ui` | Integrate shadcn/ui component library |
| `remotion` | Generate demo/walkthrough videos |

The orchestrator automatically uses these tools when a project has a frontend component. They are invoked during:
- **DESIGN phase:** `enhance-prompt` → `stitch-design` → `design-md` for screen designs and design systems
- **DEVELOPMENT phase:** `stitch-loop` for scaffolding, `react-components` for component code, `shadcn-ui` for UI library integration
- **REVIEW phase:** `remotion` for generating sprint demo videos

## Reference Files

These files contain the detailed specifications the orchestrator needs. They are loaded on demand — not all at once:

- **`references/agent-registry.md`** — Complete mapping of which agents to spawn per phase, tech stack decision matrix, concurrency limits. Read when selecting agents for a phase.
- **`references/phase-definitions.md`** — Entry/exit criteria, activities, error handling for all 8 phases. Read when executing a specific phase.
- **`references/templates.md`** — File templates for config.json, sprint plans, results, dashboard, etc. Read when creating PDLC artifacts.

## Bundled Agents

These are the core PDLC agents bundled with this skill. Read them when spawning the relevant subagent.

- **`agents/pdlc-orchestrator.md`** — The master conductor. Read this file and use its instructions as the system prompt when spawning the orchestrator.
- **`agents/sprint-ceremony-manager.md`** — Sprint ceremony coordinator. The orchestrator spawns this for all Scrum ceremonies.
- **`agents/github-ops-manager.md`** — GitHub operations coordinator. The orchestrator spawns this for commits, PRs, issues, and releases.

The 50+ general-purpose agents (react-specialist, backend-engineer, code-reviewer, etc.) are optional. If not installed, the orchestrator degrades gracefully with its built-in retry/fallback chain.
